Kaggle House Price Prediction


This is the competition hosted by kaggle to predict the house prices using advanced regression techniques. 
The first part of this challenge was aimed to understand, to analyse and to process those dataset. I wanted to produce meaningful information with plots. 
The second part was to build a model and use a Machine Learning library in order to predict the count.
